Cardbaord 4.0
=============
A set of binaries designed for easy, modular scriptable Discord bot use.

Some of these binaries and most of these scripts are designed for a specific game of Nomic my friends and I are playing.

Check out our progress at https://milksoup.net/nomic/

Synopsis
========
`make`

- the binaries will be in bin/

- example scripts are available in scripts/, they are essentially the code for my personal discord bots

- if you're using the scripts, you'll want to put some data in data/, see the scripts for more info
